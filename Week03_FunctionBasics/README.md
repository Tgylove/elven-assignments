Testing Require.js code with Karma
==================================

# Run with:

	./RunMocha
	
Or run it like this:

	mocha Test/


## Turn it in

Get all the tests to pass. Use the **prototype** property when declaring functions and
properties:

```javascript
MyFunction.prototype.three = 3;

MyFunction.prototype.getEight = function() {
    'use strict';
    return 8;
};
```

Make sure jshint comes back clean.

Place your work in your repository in a folder called Week03_FunctionBasics.
